When someone discovers that I'm a furry, we're often asked, "Why are you
a furry?"

There is already an entire litany of essays and YouTube videos that
answer this question already, so in the interest of not rehashing the
same points, I'm going to link to some of them and then choose to answer
a far more interesting question.

* [*What makes you a furry?* by **Majira Strawberry**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUfv8_GwvIE)
* [*Dear Parents of Furries* by **Ragehound**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atpvbMYPgzM)
* [*You're a Furry... NOW WHAT?* by **Quartz Husky**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrWKHyYC-aU)

If you don't know what a furry is, watch one of the above videos first,
or read [the Wikipedia article on furries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom).

If you're wondering why someone would choose to participate in our
community, the short answer is: the reasons are inherently personal
and there's no one reason I can provide that everyone will agree on.

Some furries really like the art, stories, music, etc. (both lascivious
and work-safe). Others like furry characters in video games and movies.
Our incredibly supportive and friendly community is an oft-cited reason
why people enjoy being a furry. Fursuiting (or cosplay in general) is
also a reason why people identify as a furry.

For some of us, it's all of the above. For others, none of the above
applies.

But ultimately, I don't think any of that matters. It's worth noting
that being a furry hurts no one, so calling furries' motives for
participating into question is a waste of everyone's time.

But there is a question in this vein that I do believe *is* worth
answering. A question that is rarely ever asked by curious non-furries.
The same question that is posed in the title of this article:

#### What *Does* Being a Furry Mean to You?

Despite what Internet trolls want you to believe, the furry fandom
intrinsically has nothing to do with sexualizing animals. In fact, I'd
argue that the fandom skews in the opposite direction entirely.

Being a furry is, to me, **an expression of [humanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism)**.

A furry's fursona can be thought of a representation of all of their
values and man's virtues askance the canvas of a symbolically significant
animal.

When you ask a furry why they chose a specific species (or hybrid) for
their fursona, the almost always relate it to their personality and
their **values**.

It may be tempting to look at this as a rejection of their humanity in
service of their ego, but there's another element that must be
considered:

The two most common elements among fursonas include **opposable thumbs**
and **the capacity for language**.

> Obviously, some people prefer to have "feral" fursonas, and they may
very well prefer to reject humanity. A cursory glance at the evening
news should be sufficient to feel sympathetic towards their choice. But
it's not one shared by furries with anthropomorphic fursona, which is
most of the community.

To me, being a furry is a celebration of humanity. It allows me to extol
my core personal values while being [silly](https://twitter.com/DuncanDaHusky/status/935926792858284032)
and fun.
